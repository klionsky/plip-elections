          <p class='question'>Why do you want to be Co-Presidents?</p>
          <p>Mihika Sridhar: I've always been really interested in student leadership...I like being a leader, and I like representing people and listening to them, talking to them and hearing their opinions.</p>
          <p>Brandon Girard: I love getting to know people, and I think I understand people very well. I understand different groups of people, what they like, what they don't like and I think I can help so much with that in that sense and also I'm a leader on the field and off the field.</p>
          <p class='question'>What would you say is the most important aspect of your platform?</p>
          <p>Sridhar: Mental health. We think it's really important that mental health stops becoming such a taboo issue. Our main idea for mental health awareness and progress on campus is having student input in initiatives set up by adults. We want people to be aware of things that are occurring on campus.</p>
          <p>Girard: Sometimes it's the small things that you don't even realize that could just brighten your day... when I say hi to [people] and I remember their name or I say hi, it just makes people feel ten times better even if they had a [bad] day...It makes people feel good about themselves.</p>
          <p class='question'>What is one thing you want people to know about you?</p>
          <p>Girard: Come talk to us if you have an idea, if you have anything to say [or] if you just want to talk. I will talk. I love talking.</p>
          <p>Sridhar: And we'll listen, too.</p>
          <p>Girard: I listen all the time, because I actually care about what [others] have to say. I'll talk but I'll talk to ask questions so that they can talk. So it's not going to be about me if we talk, it'll probably be more about you. That's okay because I like to learn about you guys and if you want to learn about me, of course. I'll listen.</p>
          <p class='question'>If you were a superhero duo, who would you be?</p>
          <p>Sridhar: Not Batman and Robin.</p>
          <p>Girard: No, because Robin is a sidekick. We can't have sidekicks. We got to have some equality here.</p>
          <p>Sridhar: Maybe we could be the sidekicks in the Avengers&hellip; like Black Widow and Hawkeye.</p>
          <p class='question'>What is your campaign theme song?</p>
          <p>Sridhar: &quot;Where Is The Love?&quot; by The Black Eyed Peas</p>
