          <h3>Theo &amp; Annette</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='col-md-6'>
          <p class='question'>Why should the two of you be the school&rsquo;s Co-Presidents?</p>
          <p>Theo: We&rsquo;re cheering for Annette and I and not necessarily against our competitors. But I think we are creative people who have interactions with a large amount of the Andover community. We have a lot of ties and connections to teachers and the administration that make decisions around the campus. Our ties with people, our associability, and the diversity in our backgrounds and views, are going to give us a degree of flexibility, creativity, and team building skills. </p>
          <p class='question'>You both mentioned that you are prefects in your Facebook posts. How would this experience help you be good Co-Presidents?</p>
          <p>Annette: I think that having the experience of prefecting opens you up, allows you to see more and reminds you of [your experiences as an underclassman]. I feel a lot of people, by Upper year, forget about some of the great memories, the struggles and the best parts of Junior year that really make it special. I think having that and knowing what is difficult allows us to see what [underclassmen experience] and do our best to make the school better for the next year of students.   Theo: I think that kind of grounding and that perspective is really helpful when you are thinking, &ldquo;What kind of changes can we make? What are the problems? And what can we just do to make people happy?&rdquo;   In your campaign, you never talk about each other as a team, but rather about your individual strengths. Why did you do this?   Theo: I think the real thing is when we look at a team, we are thinking about it as two complementary individuals rather than one unit. I do not [agree with] the idea that you want two people to make one person. You want two people who are not even going to necessarily agree 100 percent on things to get the widest array of views and to get the most productive debate and conversation. The [Co-Presidential model] is about two different individuals who are able to work together, get along well and represent very different backgrounds and areas of the Andover community.    What role do you see student Co-Presidents having in the student body, and what authority do they have over the students?</p>
          <p>Theo: As a team, [the Co-Presidents hold] a lot of weight when it comes to talking to faculty members about what bothers students [as well as] portraying to students what faculty members&rsquo; fears are. They have a minor ability, when it comes to [changing policies]... We see what they have done with School Congress and their work on the Strategic Planning Committees. David Gutierrez &rsquo;15 has had an actual role in what the new schedule is going to look like, [and] Rebecca Somer &rsquo;15 has had an actual role talking about mental health. So in terms of role, it is being there to listen, to portray, and also just really being creative in terms of how we interact with the faculty and how we propose new ideas to them. You have to be able to realize when you need to talk to people, listen to people and make compromises if you want things to actually happen. </p>
          <p class='question'>In your platform, you mention possibly establishing various support systems on campus. How would you accomplish this, and who would you work with to get these ideas through?</p>
          <p>Annette: Billy [Casagrande &rsquo;15] talked to us about an interesting idea about advising, specifically about Juniors. All Junior day students have an advising group, and that&rsquo;s kind of their dorm, if you will. [We want to have] a prefect that&rsquo;s a day student assigned to [these] advising groups, [who] would just kind of go in and hang out with everyone. [People wouldn&rsquo;t] come to a scheduled meeting, which [would] be as fun or free flowing as an advising [period] where you just kind of [hang] out and not do actual work. So that&rsquo;s where that came in. The idea [was] that the prefects would apply to a certain advisor, people would be like &ldquo;Oh, I know Ms. [X], we get along. Because I know her and work well with her, let me apply to this [group].&rdquo;</p>
          <p class='question'>You mention in your platform the idea of placing an ATM in the den, an idea brought forth by previous President Hemang Kaul &rsquo;13 that never came to fruition. Why were Kaul&rsquo;s efforts unsuccessful ?</p>
          <p>Theo: A lot of it had to do with the way [Student Council] was viewed. My Junior year, our meeting times were never consistent: people showed up sometimes, sometimes they didn&rsquo;t. No one was taking it seriously. In more recent years, we&rsquo;ve seen more people show up to meeting times, people taking the role and themselves more seriously, [which] inclines the adults to take it seriously and help make sure those relationships be established. </p>
          <p class='question'>As Co-Presidents, how would you promote a growth in the weight Student Council holds in the school?</p>
          <p>Annette: If you start off the year not taking [student council] seriously, then other people won&rsquo;t take you seriously. After that, once you know that people are intrigued and really care about what you are talking about, the conversation gets really easy. You have people willing and wanting to participate and taking the active role in trying to do stuff. We would have to stay on people, saying &ldquo;Hey, make sure you send this email out,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hey, do this.&rdquo; In the same sense, we need to stay on top of each other to make sure we&rsquo;re doing what we need to do. So having accountability is very important in continuing and strengthening the importance that Student Council has. </p>
          <p class='question'>In your campaign, you focused more on your strengths as people than on your ideas. Why?</p>
          <p>Theo: We didn&rsquo;t want to make any promises until we&rsquo;ve talked to the authority and we think that our ideas can actually happen. But, if you were to talk to us now, after we&rsquo;ve seen and talked to a lot more people, we can give you more concrete ideas of what we&rsquo;re talking about&#8230; As the debates have gone on, we&rsquo;ve certainly presented more concrete ideas we&rsquo;ve had, but when we were talking about our platforms, we didn&rsquo;t want to say something that we would have to take back. </p>
          <p class='question'>Do you think that Co-Presidents should be selected more on the basis of a pair&rsquo;s personal strengths or the ideas that they bring to the table?</p>
          <p>Annette: I think it&rsquo;s a combination. You can have good ideas and not accomplish any of them. You have to have the strength as a person and your character to own up to what you said you were going to try to do. In that sense, it&rsquo;s why we tried to focus on who we were, just to try to get people to see more about us, because not everyone is going to know us. So, trying to get them to the inside, into who we are and letting them decide if we are worth it. You&rsquo;re not voting just for ideas, you&rsquo;re voting for who they are and what they represent. </p>
          <p class='question'>Do you think there is anything in the election process that should be changed?</p>
          <p>Annette: This is my personal pet peeve. I understand the campaigning system is part of the politics, but it [should not be] about who can campaign the best. It [should be] about who has the best ideas and who&rsquo;s willing to put in the work. I think your ideas should matter more than the amount of pictures you can put [up] of yourself. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, that&rsquo;s definitely a crucial part of [the campaign], but it can be a little too much.</p>
