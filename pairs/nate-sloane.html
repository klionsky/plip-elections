          <p class='question'>Why do you want to be Co-Presidents?</p>
          <p>Sloane Sambuco: We have a lot of good ideas &mdash;we've both been here for all three years, and we just really love Andover. We want to do the best we can to make Andover a better place. We're both interested in student council &mdash;ate is an Upper rep this year &mdash;and we're excited about the prospect of being in the position to help the student body. Nate Redding: We also think it will be a great way to get to know more people on a deeper level.</p>
          <p class='question'>What would you say is the most important aspect of your platform?</p>
          <p>Redding: We believe that community and inclusivity are essentially the two components of a better Andover. One specific way we hope to foster community and inclusivity is through improving the advising system.</p>
          <p>Sambuco: The system we have now has little student input in choosing advisors. If students can choose their own advisors, the relationships will be much more valuable and the mentorship more meaningful. Also with community, we want to integrate friend groups and help people get to know everyone from the start at orientation. Also, we want to introduce student-mentoring programs based on common interests with Juniors and upperclassmen.</p>
          <p class='question'>What is one thing you want people to know about you?</p>
          <p>Redding: It's really important that people know that we always want to talk with them. One of the most important things about being a leader is knowing that your voice is not the most important one. We are so eager to learn what the students have to say.</p>
          <p class='question'>If you were a superhero duo, who would you be?</p>
          <p>Redding: I think Sloane and I would definitely be the Fantastic Four because we're fantastic and we're, like, two people in one, each of us. It's like four of us in two! It's crazy. </p>
          <p class='question'>What is your campaign theme song?</p>
          <p>Sambuco: Our theme song is probably &quot;We Can't Stop&quot; by Miley Cyrus, because we can't stop working for Andover until we do the best we can and get what you want done!</p>
          <p>Redding: As Miley said &quot;We run things, things don't run we.&quot; It's all about us, the students making Andover your Andover!</p>
          <p>Sambuco: [The students] should have a lot of say in [their] own lives!</p>
