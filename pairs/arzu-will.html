          <p class='question'>Do you think the position of Co-President or the election is more about the people filling the seats or what those people do with the position?</p>
          <p>Bergstein: It&rsquo;s a mixture. Both are important [because] there needs to be a connection between the administration and the student body. That&rsquo;s the most important role for the Co-Presidency. The right people [as Co-Presidents] means that they know a lot of people in the community, and they&rsquo;ll be able to fully serve that job effectively. If they&rsquo;re not the right type of people, then no matter what they&rsquo;re doing with the administration, they&rsquo;re not representing the student body. So you need both parts of that. Even if they&rsquo;re really effective with the administration, they need to be the right type of people. </p>
          <p class='question'>How would you two fill that position?</p>
          <p>Bergstein: Although we&rsquo;ve never been on Student Council, we have a pretty good understanding of how that system is working, and we&rsquo;ve reached out to students who have been on Student Council. We&rsquo;ve been in different parts of the community, and therefore we feel like we really understand what the student body wants, and we can take their opinions and then effectively work them into plans with the administration. </p>
          <p>Singh: Some of our strengths in the role would be representing the student body in a really unique way, because we are very different, [and] although we have some of the same interests, we still are different people, we do different things on campus, but we know what it&rsquo;ll take to serve as representatives and get things done. </p>
          <p class='question'>What made you choose the &ldquo;House of Cards&rdquo; theme for your campaign poster? Where were you trying to go with that?</p>
          <p>Bergstein: I don&rsquo;t think there was a specific meaning, a lot of people came up to me and were like &ldquo;What was the meaning of that?&rdquo; It was basically just to be funny.</p>
          <p>Singh: [The poster] had a pretty lighthearted intent. We knew it was a show everyone liked, and that it had [a] political thread. We thought it would be fun. </p>
          <p class='question'>Your campaign primarily focused on your friendship and your ability to work as a pair. Why did you decide to campaign this way? </p>
          <p>Singh: I would say that this is a Co-Presidency, and so, because of that, collaboration and teamwork is really essential to the position, because it&rsquo;s seen as a one-entity position. There are two people, and that&rsquo;s such a big part of the position, and it&rsquo;s really important to make the most of that two-person role. </p>
          <p class='question'>In your platform, you say &lsquo;&ldquo;[Andover] isn&rsquo;t the united, cohesive community it claims to be.&rdquo; Why do you think this is? What&rsquo;s an example of this?</p>
          <p>Singh: A lot of times, we find that, once students come in, especially Juniors, it&rsquo;s difficult for students to meet people who aren&rsquo;t in their cluster or aren&rsquo;t in some of their classes. We want to provide opportunities for students to meet kids that they otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t, because this is a really big school, with so many amazing people and so much diversity of experiences. It&rsquo;s an amazingly diverse student body, and we could do more to allow students to meet each other and really make friendships beyond the typical small pools that they do initially. Because, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s easiest a lot of times. I know I came in as a Junior, and I found it pretty hard to meet people that weren&rsquo;t in my dorm, or in some of my classes. So, really, encouraging a shift in culture where it&rsquo;s easier to get to know other people and an emphasis on being a more unified school with a sense of solidarity through more connections across campus&ndash;that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going for.</p>
          <p class='question'>Another point in your platform: you talked about the good reception to Exeter&rsquo;s new peer counselor system, but Exeter and Andover are two different schools. How do you plan to adapt this program to fit Andover?</p>
          <p>Singh: We are two different schools, but I think people like to look over the fact that fundamentally, we&rsquo;re very similar. If you look at their curriculum, their curriculum is very similar to ours. We are sister schools, and yes, we have this rivalry, but it would be false to say we&rsquo;re an entirely different school, and programs there won&rsquo;t necessarily work here. We wouldn&rsquo;t just be implanting their model into our school, [but] we&rsquo;d be using that as a guide to institute something similar here. </p>
          <p class='question'>How often will the open Student Council meetings you mentioned in your platform occur? </p>
          <p>Singh: We&rsquo;re hoping every three to four council meetings. Student Council meets biweekly at 8 a.m., and so hopefully every three to four [meetings] will be open to the entire student body. Because we were never class reps ourselves, we&rsquo;re really committed to making sure everybody can voice their ideas, and everybody can just know what&rsquo;s going on in Student Council, even if they&rsquo;re not one of those one or two class reps. There&rsquo;s more than two or three voices per grade, and they deserve to be heard. </p>
          <p class='question'>Describe a time at which you&rsquo;ve struggled at Andover. </p>
          <p>Bergstein: I&rsquo;d say Upper fall was pretty tough. I had a lot of clubs, and I had six classes, and I wasn&rsquo;t getting a lot of sleep. So, Upper fall was tough for me, but I bounced back in Upper winter, got myself on track, [and Upper fall] wasn&rsquo;t the end of the world.</p>
          <p>Singh: I would say Junior fall. I think that&rsquo;s a really tough time for a lot of people. I thought I was more ready to leave home than I really was, so I was pretty homesick, and I think a lot of people come here ready to meet people, ready to make friends, ready to take Andover by storm, and I wasn&rsquo;t. I think I definitely lacked some confidence when I first came here, too, so I had a really hard time trying to get out and meet people if I didn&rsquo;t initially know them. I think that over the course of my years here, I&rsquo;ve definitely grown more and become more confident and definitely become less homesick.</p>
          <p class='question'>How do you think some of these struggles at Andover have helped you guys to become better potential Co-Presidents?</p>
          <p>Singh: I think my struggle, specifically, is not unique at all. I think if a lot of people were to say their toughest time at Andover, it would be likely that a lot of people would say Junior fall. I think that a large portion of our platform is geared towards easing the transition for new students. We have an idea in our platforms, Freshman Seminars, which has been met with good reception by the faculty and administration on campus. That&rsquo;s to help ease the transition of new students, and to let them meet other Juniors and talk about stuff on campus that&rsquo;s really relevant, [such as] depression, anxiety [and] stress [and] to start healthy, good habits their first year here, before Upper fall hits them.</p>
